# nf-core/configs: TIGEM configuration

To use, run the pipeline with `-profile tigem`. This will download and launch the tigem.config which has been pre-configured with a setup suitable for the TIGEM personal biocluster.

---

For this pipeline you need a docker container containing the tools needed for the specific pipeline. You can find the docker containers on giusmar docker hub profile. A docker image containing the required software will be downloaded, and converted to a Singularity image before execution of the pipeline.
