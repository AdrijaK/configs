# nf-core/configs: Sheffield Hallam University BMRC Cluster Configuration

## Using the Institutional Configuration Profile

To use [`shu_bmrc.config`](../conf/shu_bmrc.config), run nextflow with an nf-core pipeline using `-profile shu_bmrc` (note the single hyphen).

This will download and launch [`shu_bmrc.config`](../conf/shu_bmrc.config) which has been pre-configured with a setup suitable for the BMRC cluster and will automatically load the appropriate pipeline-specific configuration file.

## Running nf-core Pipelines on the BMRC Cluster

A detailed guide to setting up Nextflow and nf-core and running pipelines on the BMRC Cluster is available here: [Running Nextflow with nf-core Pipelines on SHU BMRC Cluster](https://github.com/lquayle88/nfcore_on_shu_bmrc)
