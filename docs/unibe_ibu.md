# nf-core/configs: UNIBE_IBU Configuration

Configuration file to run nf-core pipelines on the cluster of the [Interfaculty Bioinformatics Unit](https://www.bioinformatics.unibe.ch/) of the University of Bern.

To use, run the pipeline with `-profile unibe_ibu`. This requires a local installation of singularity, so you have to run the pipeline from a compute node.
